Digital Technologies has decided to make some updates to the employee profile. So they like to add PAN number and E-mail ID in each profile. Help the firm to validate the PAN number and E-mail ID given by employees using the Java program

Requirements:

-        PAN number should have exactly ten characters. The first 5 characters should be alphabets in uppercase, the next four characters should be digits from 0 to 9 and the last character should be an alphabet in uppercase

-        If the PAN number fails the above condition, then print "<PAN number> is an invalid PAN number" and terminate the program.

-        E-mail should end with "@digitec.com", before @ there should be at least 5 to maximum 10 characters. All characters should be in lowercase

-        IF E-mail ID fails the above condition, then print "Invalid E-mail ID" and terminate the program.

Note:
