Henry gave an assignment to his students. He gave a set of numbers to his students and the students have to find whether it's a prime number or not. If it is a prime number then the students have to add only the prime number to get that number as the result. Write a Java program to help the students to solve this problem

Requirements:

-        The array size should be between 1 to 5 (both inclusive), else print "<array size> is an invalid array size".

-        The number should be greater than 0 and less than 100 (both not inclusive), else print "<number> is an invalid input".

-        If there is no sum of prime numbers print "The <array size> numbers are not sum of prime numbers".

-        If there is more than one sum of prime number in the array then print that number also.

-        The prime number should be added in a consecutive manner

Note:

-        In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.

-        Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.

-        Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.

-        Adhere to the code template, if provided

Please do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the program.

Sample Input/Output 1:

Enter the array size

4

Enter the numbers

12

17

5

7

The sum of prime numbers is

17

5

Explanation

12 is not a prime number

17 is a prime number so add a consecutive prime number

2+3+5+7 = 17

17 is the sum of prime number

5 is a prime number so add a consecutive prime number

2+3= 5

5 is the sum of prime number

7 is a prime number so add a consecutive prime number

2+3+5 = 10>7

7 is not sum of prime number

Ouputs are 17 ,5

 

Sample Input/Output 2:

Enter the array size

3

Enter the numbers

8

22

7

The 3 numbers are not sum of prime numbers

 

Sample Input/Output 3:

Enter the array size

-5

-5 is an invalid array size

 

Sample Input/Output 4:

Enter the array size

4

Enter the numbers

-6

-6 is an invalid input
