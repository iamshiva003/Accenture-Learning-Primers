Aravind's teacher gives him an assignment on the topic "array." He got two arrays as input, and in those he has to add the elements of both arrays and store them in a new array, and then only add the last digits of all elements from the third array and store them in a new variable and check if it is a prime number or not. Help Aravind complete his assignment using Java.

Requirements:

If both the array size is not the same, print "Both array size is different" then terminate the program.
If the size is less than or equal to zero, print "<size> is an invalid array size" then terminate the program.
If the elements entered in an array have a value less than zero, print "<arrValue> is an invalid input" and then terminate the program.
Note:

In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.
Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.
Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.
Adhere to the code template, if provided
Please do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the program.

 

Sample input/Output1:

Enter the size of first array

4

Enter the array elements

2

3

4

5

Enter the size of second array

4

Enter the array elements

6

6

6

18 is not a prime number

 Explanation

 Array1 = {2,3,4,5}

Array2 = {6,6,6,6}

add the integers in the two arrays -> Array1[0] + Array2[0] = Array3[0]

2+ 6 = 8

3+6=9

4+6=10

5+6=11

Array3 = {8,9,10,11}

In a new variable only add last digits in a Array[3]

8+9+0+1=18

Check 18 for prime number

Hence 18 is not a prime number

 

Sample input/output2:

Enter the size of first array

2

Enter the array elements

0

23

Enter the size of second array

2

Enter the array elements

23

25

11 is a prime number

 Explanation

 Array1 = {0,23}

Array2 = {23,25}

add the integers in the two arrays -> Array1[0] + Array2[0] = Array3[0]

0+ 23 = 23

23+25=48

Array3 = {23,48}

In a new variable only add last digits in a Array[3]

3+8=18

Check 11 for prime number

Hence 11 is a prime number

 

Sample input/Output3:

 Enter the size of first array

-2

-2 is an invalid array size

 

Sample input/Output4:

 Enter the size of first array

3

Enter the array elements

1

2

3

Enter the size of second array

-2

-2 is an invalid array size

 

Sample input/Output5:

 Enter the size of first array

2

Enter the array elements

-3

-3 is an invalid input

 

Sample input/Output6:

 Enter the size of first array

1

Enter the array elements

23

Enter the size of second array

2

Both array size is different
