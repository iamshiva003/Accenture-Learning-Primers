Mr. Vicky gave a task to his students. He gave two words, but there were some spelling mistakes found. In the first string, "!" denotes the misspelt word. The second string has the correct spelling of the first string. Create a Java application and help the students remove the "!" and replace it with the correctly spelled character.

Requirements:

-        Both the Strings must be of the same length. Otherwise, print "Length of the strings <String1> and <String2> does not match"

-        Both the Strings must contain only alphabets and '!' symbol. Otherwise, print "<String> contains invalid symbols"

-       If both the strings contain invalid symbols, print "<String1> and <String2> contains invalid symbols"

-        The output must have the combined string without any symbols

Assume that space is allowed in between the words and assume that the second string always will have the correct spelt character of the misspelt first string in the respective positions.

Note:

-        In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.
