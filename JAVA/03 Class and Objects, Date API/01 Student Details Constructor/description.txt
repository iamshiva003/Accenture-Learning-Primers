Sarah got confused to creating the constructor. Write a Java application to help Sarah to do this.

Type(Class)

Attributes

Methods

Responsibilities

Student

int studentId

String studentName

String studentAddress

String collegeName

Include the getters and setters method for all the attributes.

 

 

Student

 

Include a public parametrized constructor of four arguments in the following order - studentId, studentName, studentAddress, and collegeName to initialize the values for the Student object

If student belongs to other college, give input as 'no/NO' and get college name from the user and create student object with 4-argument constructor to initialize all the values. 

 

Student

 

Include a public parametrized constructor of three arguments in the following order - studentId, studentName, studentAddress, and collegeName should be "NIT" to initialize the values for the Student object

If student belongs to NIT, give input as 'yes/YES' and skip input for the attribute collegeName and create student object with 3-argument constructor to initilze the values for studentId, studentName and studentAddress and  collegeName as "NIT".

 

 

Note: The class and methods should be declared as public and all the attributes should be declared as private. 

 

In the UserInterface class, write the main method to test the application.

Assume most of the students are from "NIT" college. So user has to give input whether the student is from NIT or not.

Instead of Yes / No, if user enters different input then display 'Wrong Input' and get the input again.

 Note:

-         In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.

-         Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.

-         Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.

-         Adhere to the code template, if provided.

-         Please do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the program
