1. Parse the input string to Date (say Date d) using SimpleDateFormat

2. Use Calendar to add months

        Calendar c = Calendar.getInstannce();  //Get Instance

         c.setTime(dd1);   // Set date to Calendar

         c.add(Calendar.MONTH, month);  //add month value to the Calendar

3. Convert Calendar to Date using getTime               

                     Date dd=c.getTime();

4. Use the same SimpleDateFormat and convert date to String of the format dd/MM/yyyy using the format method.
