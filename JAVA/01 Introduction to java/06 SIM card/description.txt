Requirements:

-       Use long datatype for Phone number.

-       If the sum of the odd numbers and sum of the even numbers in the phone number are equal, print as "Sum of odd and even are equal".

-       If the sum of the even numbers is greater than the sum of the odd numbers in the phone number, then print as "Sum of even is greater than sum of odd".

-       If the sum of the odd numbers is greater than the sum of the even numbers in the phone number, then print as "Sum of odd is greater than sum of even".

 

Note:

-       In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.

-       Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.
